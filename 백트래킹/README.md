## BackTracking
- Backtracking is a gerneral algorithm for finding solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems.
- Constraint satisfaction problems(CSPs) are mathmatical questions defined as a set of objects whose sate must satisfy a number of constraints or limitations.
- a technique for listing all possible solutions for a combinational algorithm problem. 
- ex) permutation, combination, n-queen using DFS, BSF ect..
